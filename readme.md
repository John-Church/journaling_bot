### Install

1. Install Ollama: https://ollama.ai/ (you can use homebrew or the installer just make sure it is running)
2. Install the Mistral weights with `ollama pull mistral`
3. run `poetry install` (make sure you have poetry installed first! You can instal it with brew. It's just a python package manager.)
4. run `poetry run python main.py

The first time the program runs it will take a while to start as it needs to download the model weights for whisper medium.
